        DNS over TLS: Initiation and Performance Considerations
                   draft-ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls-01

Abstract

   This document describes the use of TLS to provide privacy for DNS.
   Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping
   on DNS queries in the network, such as discussed in RFC 7258.  In
   addition, this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS-over-TLS
   and provides advice on performance considerations to minimize
   overheads from using TCP and TLS with DNS.

Internet-Draft                DNS over TLS                   August 2015


1.  Introduction

   Today, nearly all DNS queries ([RFC1034] and [RFC1035]) are sent
   unencrypted, which makes them vulnerable to eavesdropping by an
   attacker that has access to the network channel, reducing the privacy
   of the querier.  Recent news reports have elevated these concerns,
   and ongoing efforts are beginning to identify privacy concerns about
   DNS ([I-D.ietf-dprive-problem-statement]).

   Prior work has addressed some aspects of DNS security, but until
   recently there has been little work on privacy between a DNS client
   and server.  DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC, [RFC4033]) provide
   _response integrity_ by defining mechanisms to cryptographically sign
   zones, allowing end-users (or their first-hop resolver) to verify
   replies are correct.  By intention, DNSSEC does not protect request
   and response privacy.  Traditionally, either privacy was not
   considered a requirement for DNS traffic, or it was assumed that
   network traffic was sufficiently private, however these perceptions
   are evolving due to recent events [RFC7258].

   DNSCurve [draft-dempsky-dnscurve] defines a method to add
   confidentiality to the link between DNS clients and servers; however,
   it does so with a new cryptographic protocol and does not take
   advantage of an existing standard protocol such as TLS.
   ConfidentialDNS [draft-wijngaards-confidentialdns] and IPSECA
   [draft-osterweil-dane-ipsec] use opportunistic encryption to offer
   privacy for DNS queries and responses.  Finally, others have
   suggested DNS-over-TLS.  Unbound DNS software [unbound] includes a
   DNS-over-TLS implementation.  The DNS over DTLS (DNSoD)
   [draft-ietf-dprive-dnsodtls] proposal describes how to secure UDP-
   based DNS messages with DTLS.  This document describes using DNS-
   over-TLS over a well-known port and offers advice on performance
   considerations.

   Initiation of DNS-over-TLS is very straightforward.  By establishing
   a connection over a well-known port, clients and servers expect and
   agree to negotiate a TLS session to secure the channel.  Deployment
   will gradual.  Not all servers will support DNS-over-TLS and the
   well-known port might be blocked by some firewalls.  Clients will be
   expected to keep track of servers that support TLS and those that
   don't.  Furthermore, as is generally the case with TLS, it is subject
   to downgrade attacks, as discussed in Section 7.

   The protocol described here works for any DNS client to server
   communication using DNS-over-TCP.  That is, it may be used for
   queries and responses between stub clients and recursive servers as
   well as between recursive clients and authoritative servers.

Internet-Draft                DNS over TLS                   August 2015


   This document describes two profiles in Section 3 providing different
   levels of assurance of privacy: an opportunistic privacy profile and
   a pre-deployed profile.

   An earlier version of this document described a technique for
   upgrading a DNS-over-TCP connection to a DNS-over-TLS session.  This
   was, essentially, "STARTTLS for DNS," which would have used a newly
   defined bit in the EDNS0 flags field to signal willingness to upgrade
   to TLS.  The upgrade approach no longer appears in this document,
   which now focuses exclusively on the use of a well-known port for
   DNS-over-TLS.  The same port would be used by DNS-over-DTLS.

1.1.  Reserved Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Establishing DNS-over-TLS Sessions

   A DNS server that supports DNS-over-TLS SHOULD listen for and accept
   TCP connections on port TBD.

   DNS clients desiring privacy from DNS-over-TLS from a particular
   server SHOULD establish a TCP connection to port TBD on the server.
   Upon successful establishment of the TCP connection, client and
   server SHOULD immediately initiate a TLS handshake using the
   procedure described in [RFC5246].

   DNS clients SHOULD remember server IP addresses that don't support
   DNS-over-TLS, including, timeouts, connection refusals, and TLS
   handshake failures, and not request DNS-over-TLS from them for a
   reasonable period (such as one hour per server).  DNS clients
   following a pre-deployed privacy profile MAY be more aggressive about
   retrying DNS-over-TLS connection failures.

   After TLS negotiation completes, the connection will be encrypted and
   is now protected from eavesdropping.  At this point, normal DNS
   queries SHOULD take place.  All messages (requests and responses) in
   the established TLS session MUST use the two-octet length field
   described in Section 4.2.2 of [RFC1035].  For reasons of efficiency,
   DNS clients and servers SHOULD transmit the two-octet length field,
   and the message described by that length field, in a single TCP
   segment ([I-D.ietf-dnsop-5966bis], Section 8).

   For DNS clients that use library functions such as "gethostbyname()",
   current implementations are known to open and close UDP connections



Hu, et al.              Expires February 26, 2016               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                DNS over TLS                   August 2015


   each DNS call.  To avoid many TCP connections, each with a single
   query, clients SHOULD reuse a single TCP connection to the recursive
   resolver.  Alternatively they may prefer to use UDP to a DNS-over-TLS
   enabled caching resolver on the same machine that then uses a system-
   wide TCP connection to the recursive resolver.

   In order to amortize TCP and TLS connection setup costs, clients and
   servers SHOULD NOT immediately close a connection after each
   response.  Instead, clients and servers SHOULD reuse existing
   connections for subsequent queries as long as they have sufficient
   resources.  In some cases, this means that clients and servers may
   need to keep idle connections open for some amount of time.

   Proper management of established and idle connections is important to
   the healthy operation of a DNS server.  An implementor of DNS-over-
   TLS SHOULD follow best practices for DNS-over-TCP, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-5966bis].  Failure to do so may lead to resource
   exhaustion and denial-of-service.

   Whereas client and server implementations from the [RFC1035] era are
   known to have poor TCP connection management, this document
   stipulates that successful negotiation of TLS indicates the
   willingness of both parties to keep idle DNS connections open,
   independent of timeouts or other recommendations for DNS-over-TCP
   without TLS.  In other words, software implementing this protocol is
   assumed to support idle, persistent connections and to have good
   connection management.

   This document does not make specific recommendations for timeout
   values on idle connections.  Clients and servers should reuse and/or
   close connections depending on the level of available resources.
   Timeouts may be longer during periods of low activity and shorter
   during periods of high activity.  Current work in this area may also
   assist DNS-over-TLS clients and servers select useful timeout values
   [draft-wouters-edns-tcp-keepalive] [tdns].

   Clients and servers that keep idle connections open MUST be robust to
   termination of idle connection by either party.  As with current DNS-
   over-TCP, DNS servers MAY close the connection at any time (e.g., due
   to resource constraints).  As with current DNS-over-TCP, clients MUST
   handle abrupt closes and be prepared to reestablish connections
   and/or retry queries.

   When closing a connection, DNS servers SHOULD use the TLS close-
   notify request to shift TCP TIME-WAIT state to the clients.
   Additional requirements and guidance for optimizing DNS-over-TCP are
   provided by [RFC5966], [I-D.ietf-dnsop-5966bis].  As discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-5966bis], TCP Fast Open [RFC7413] is of benefit.

3.  Usage Profiles

   This protocol provides flexibility to accommodate several different
   use cases.  Two usage profiles are defined here to identify specific
   design points in performance and privacy.  Other profiles are
   possible but are outside the scope of this document.

3.1.  Opportunistic Privacy Profile

   For opportunistic privacy, analogous to SMTP opportunistic encryption
   [RFC7435] one desires privacy when possible, but does not require it.

   With opportunistic privacy, a client might acquire a TLS-enabled
   recursive DNS resolver from an untrusted source (such as DHCP while
   roaming), it might or might not validate the TLS certificate.  These
   choices maximize availability and performance, but they are
   vulnerable to on-path attacks.

   Opportunistic privacy can be used by any current client, but it only
   provides guaranteed privacy when there are no on-path active
   attackers.

3.2.  Pre-Deployed Profile

   For pre-deployed privacy, the DNS client has one or more trusted
   recursive DNS providers.  This profile provides strong privacy
   guarantees to the user.

   With pre-deployed privacy, a client retains a copy of the TLS
   certificate (and/or other authentication credentials as appropriate)
   and IP address of each provider.  The client will only use one of
   those DNS providers.  Because it has a pre-deployed TLS certificate,
   it may detect person-in-the-middle and downgrade attacks.

   With pre-deployed privacy, the DNS client MUST signal to the user
   when none of the designated DNS servers are available, and MUST NOT
   provide DNS service until at least one of the designated DNS servers
   becomes available.

   The designated DNS provider may be temporarily unavailable when
   configuring a network.  For example, for clients on networks that
   require authentication through web-based login, such authentication
   may rely on DNS interception and spoofing.  Techniques such as those
   used by DNSSEC-trigger [dnssec-trigger] MAY be used during network
   configuration, with the intent to transition to the designated DNS
   provider after authentication.  The user MUST be alerted that the DNS
   is not private during such bootstrap.

Internet-Draft                DNS over TLS                   August 2015


   Methods for pre-deployment of the designated DNS provider are outside
   the scope of this document.  In corporate settings, such information
   may be provided at system installation.  Use of multiple public DNS
   providers suggests that end users are able to configure DNS by hand.


4.  Performance Considerations

   DNS-over-TLS incurs additional latency at session startup.  It also
   requires additional state (memory) and increased processing (CPU).

   1.  Latency: Compared to UDP, DNS-over-TCP requires an additional
       round-trip-time (RTT) of latency to establish a TCP connection.
       TCP Fast Open [RFC7413] can eliminate that RTT for some users.
       The TLS handshake adds another two RTTs of latency.  Clients and
       servers should support connection keepalive (reuse) and out-of-
       order processing to amortize connection setup costs.  Moreover,
       TLS connection resumption can further reduce the setup delay.
       DNS servers SHOULD enable fast TLS session resumption [RFC5077]
       to avoid keeping per-client session state.  TLS False Start
       [draft-tls-falsestart] can also lead to a latency reduction in
       certain situations.

   2.  State: The use of connection-oriented TCP requires keeping
       additional state in both kernels and applications.  TLS has
       marginal increases in state over TCP alone.  The state
       requirements are of particular concerns on servers with many
       clients.  Smaller timeout values will reduce the number of
       concurrent connections, and servers can preemptively close
       connections when resources limits are exceeded.

   3.  Processing: Use of TLS encryption algorithms results in slightly
       higher CPU usage.  Servers can choose to refuse new DNS-over-TLS
       clients if processing limits are exceeded.

   4.  Number of connections: To minimize state on DNS servers and
       connection startup time, clients SHOULD minimize creation of new
       TCP connections.  Use of a local DNS request aggregator (a
       particular type of forwarder) allows a single active DNS-over-TLS
       connection from any given client computer to its server.
       Additional guidance can be found in [I-D.ietf-dnsop-5966bis].

   A full performance evaluation is outside the scope of this
   specification.  A more detailed analysis of the performance
   implications of DNS-over-TLS (and DNS-over-TCP) is discussed in a
   technical report [tdns] and [I-D.ietf-dnsop-5966bis].

   IANA is requested add the following value to the "Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" registry.  That registry is
   populated by expert review [RFC6335], and such a review will be
   requested if this document progresses.

6.  Implementation Status

   [Note to RFC Editor: please remove this section and reference to RFC
   6982 prior to publication.]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC 6982.
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 6982, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

6.1.  Unbound

   The Unbound recursive name server software added support for DNS-
   over-TLS in version 1.4.14.  The unbound.conf configuration file has
   the following configuration directives: ssl-port, ssl-service-key,
   ssl-service-pem, ssl-upstream.  See

6.2.  ldns

   Sinodun Internet Technologies has implemented DNS-over-TLS in the
   ldns library from NLnetLabs.  This also gives DNS-over-TLS support to
   the drill DNS client program.  Patches available at https://

   The getdns API implementation supports DNS-over-TLS.  Source code
   available at https://getdnsapi.net.


7.  Security Considerations

   Use of DNS-over-TLS is designed to address the privacy risks that
   arise out of the ability to eavesdrop on DNS messages.  It does not
   address other security issues in DNS, and there are a number of
   residual risks that may affect its success at protecting privacy:

   1.  There are known attacks on TLS, such as person-in-the-middle and
       protocol downgrade.  These are general attacks on TLS and not
       specific to DNS-over-TLS; please refer to the TLS RFCs for
       discussion of these security issues.  Keeping track of servers
       known to support TLS (i.e., "pinning") enables clients to detect
       downgrade attacks.  For servers with no connection history and no
       apparent support for TLS, clients may, depending on their privacy
       requirements, choose to (a) try another server when available,
       (b) continue without TLS, or (c) refuse to forward the query.

   2.  Middleboxes [RFC3234] may be present in some networks and have
       been known to interfere with normal DNS resolution and create
       problems for DNS-over-TLS.  In general, clients that attempt TLS
       and fail can either fall back on unencrypted DNS, or wait and
       retry later, depending on their privacy requirements.

   3.  Any protocol interactions prior to the TLS handshake are
       performed in the clear and can be modified by a person-in-the-
       middle attacker.  For this reason, clients MAY discard cached
       information about server capabilities advertised prior to the

       start of the TLS handshake.

   4.  This document does not propose new ideas to resist known traffic
       analysis techniques.  Even with encrypted messages, a well-
       positioned party may be able to glean certain details from an
       analysis of message timings and sizes.

   5.  This document does not propose new ideas for certificate
       authentication for TLS in the context of DNS.  Several external
       methods are possible, although each has weaknesses.  The current
       Certificate Authority infrastructure [RFC5280] is used by HTTP/
       TLS [RFC2818].  With many trusted CAs, this approach has
       recognized weaknesses [CA_Compromise].  Some work is underway to
       partially address these concerns (for example, with certificate
       pinning [certificate_pinning], but more work is needed.  DANE
       [RFC6698] provides mechanisms to root certificate trust with
       DNSSEC.  That use here must be carefully evaluated to address
       potential issues in trust recursion.  For stub-to-recursive
       resolver use, certificate authentication is sometimes either easy
       or nearly impossible.  If the recursive resolver is manually
       configured, its certificate can be authenticated when it is
       configured.  If the recursive resolver is automatically
       configured (such as with DHCP [RFC2131]), it could use DHCP
       authentication mechanisms [RFC3118]).  Ongoing discussion and
       development of opportunistic TLS (connections without CA
       validation, [RFC7435]) may be relevant to DNS-over-TLS.
